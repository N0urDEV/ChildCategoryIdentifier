# ChildCategoryIdentifier
"ChildAgeCategoryIdentifier" is a simple Python script that takes the age of a child as input and determines their sports category based on age. The script classifies the child into one of the following categories: "Poussin" for ages 6-7, "Pupille" for ages 8-9, "Minime" for ages 10-11, or "Cadet" for ages outside of these ranges. It then displays the determined category for the given age. This script is useful for organizing youth sports activities or events based on age groups.
